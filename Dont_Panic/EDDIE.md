# Infinite Logic 
*By a kind of idealization, logic lets a single symbol stand for an ineffably complex reality.* 
lumpy formulas, smooth mathematical shapes


Eddy(self, drive):


    drive = self.drive
    probability = self.probability
    improbability = self.probability
    infinity_log = self.infinity_log

    
    generator = self.generator
    infinity = self.infinity
    logic = self.logic

    hog = self.hog # heart of gold spaceship

Mathematics is a universal language in which we find both the spotty and the smooth, the discrete and the continuous. 
A pattern is discrete if it is made up of separate, distinct bits. It is continuous if its parts blend into an indivisible whole. 

Viewed as three dots, a triangle is discrete; but viewed as three lines, a triangle is continuous. What gives mathematics so much of its power is that it contains a variety of tools

The two most important tools for bridging the gap between space and number are logic and infinity.


The use of logical techniques enables us to move back and forth between lumpy formulas and smooth mathematical shapes.

BRAINS : Analog+Digital
Many of the intellectual tasks a brain performs can be thought of as primarily digital or primarily analog. 

studies suggest our left brain is in charge of digital manipulations and the right brain is in charge of analog activities. 

brain.split(left, right)

left = digital[number]
right = analog[space]

brain.left = 

the number-space split is a fundamental feature of reality, 
 brains have evolved so as to be able to deal with both modes of existence.

analog : the smooth interaction of physical forces. 
- The old-fashioned analog watch uses a system of gears to move its hands in smooth sweeps, analogous to the flow of time. 
- Loosely speaking, an analog watch is a kind of scale model of the solar system. 

digital : manipulating distinct chunks of information.
The newer digital watches count the vibrations of a small crystal, process the count through a series of switches, and display the digits of a number which names the time.



Arithmetic is certainly a digital activity, and spelling out a printed word is also a basically digital activity. Each of these activities is a “step-at-a-time” process, involving such steps as reading a symbol, finding a meaning for the symbol, and combining two symbols. 

Singing a song to music, on the other hand, is an analog activity — the speech organs are continuously adjusted to produce tones matching the smoothly varying music. (The digital note patterns of sheet music are but the sluices through which performance flows.) 

Recognizing a scene in a photograph is also believed to be an analog activity of the brain; the brain seems to see the picture “all at once” rather than to divide it up into lumps of information.

#In the 1960s, a variety of experiments involving people with various kinds of brain injuries suggested that, as a rule, the left brain is in charge of digital manipulations and the right brain is in charge of analog activities. Recently this phenomenon has been directly observed by means of PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans that show that the left brain’s metabolism speeds up for digital tasks, while the right brain’s activity increases during analog tasks. In other words, the left half of your brain thinks in terms of number, and the right half of your brain thinks in terms of space.

Is it the internal division of brain function that causes us to see the world in terms of the thesis—antithesis pattern of spotty and smooth? Perhaps, but I think the converse is more likely. That is, I think it is more likely that the number-space split is a fundamental feature of reality, and that our brains have evolved so as to be able to deal with both modes of existence.
