III - 
three systems are presented in order to understand how signatures are generated
	Transmission Spec / Photometry
	Emission Spec / Radial Velocity
	Computer Vision / Direct Imaging

IV - 
presents and discusses 12 approaches for machine learning/artificial neural networks
	ANN, CNN, RNN (LSTM), Autoencoders, BDMs



V
classification criteria are defined and sig generation mechanisms from IV are classified according to them
